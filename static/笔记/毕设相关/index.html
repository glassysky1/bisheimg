Electronic commerce, or Electronic trade, or electronic business as a newly rising
mode of commerce will have far-reaching influence on social economy and play an
important role in social development worldwide. It represents the trend of world trade
in the 21st century and beyond.
<br>
1. What is Electronic Commerce?
<br>

Electronic commerce refers to commercial data exchange in digital form through
electronic transmission means and commercial activities conducted on-line. Usually,
electronic commerce can be divided into two levels: One is low-level electronic
commerce that is, electronic commercial intelligence, electronic trade, and electronic
contracts. Another is high-level electronic commerce which includes all commercial
activities done via Internet, ranging from searching for clients, commercial negotiation, making orders, on-line
payment, releasing electronic invoice, to electronic declaration to Customs, electronic tax-payment, all conducted on
Internet.
<br>

Electronic commerce means electrification of all trade transactions. It is featured
by these characters: ①fairness and freedom, ②high efficiency, ③globalization, ④
virtualization, ⑤interactivity, ⑥autonomy, ⑦personalized service. With electronic
commerce, clients and suppliers can closely and conveniently contact with each other
on a global scale, so that clients can find satisfactory suppliers from all comers of the
world to meet their demands.
<br>

Electronic commerce will change the environment in which enterprises compete
with each other and reduce costs which would otherwise be high in traditional market
structure. Low costs in transactions, convenience in market entry and government
encouragement to use Internet (exemption from tax) activate electronic commerce and
boost it to develop rapidly right from its beginning. As experts predicted, by 2000,
electronic commerce would reach a scale of 300billion US dollars worldwide. And it
has exceeded this scale.
<br>

To ensure security of electronic commerce, an electronic certification center
should be established. Digital ID is used to validate identity. Digital 11 is trusted to a
third party, namely, an authorized agency, to release, including identifying information of the holder (name, address,
liaison way, ID card number), an encryptive key for
common use by the both parties, period of validity, password and identification information of the authorized agency,
etc. With digital ID, both parties in transactions
can be assured of identifying the other party and validate that the information sent out
from the other party has not been subject to alteration.
<br>
2. Influence That Electronic Commerce May Have
Compared with traditional commerce, electronic commerce has superiorities as
follows
<br>
*Extensive coverage. A network system combining Internet, Intranet (local area
network inside enterprises) and Extranet (networks outside enterprises) enables buyers, sellers, manufacturers and their
partners to contact with each other and conveniently transmit commercial intelligence and documents worldwide.
*Complete functions. In electronic commerce, users of different types and on different tiers can realize different
targets in trade, for example, releasing commercial
intelligence, on-line negotiation, electronic payment, establishment of virtual commercial market place and on-line
banking, etc.
<br>

*Convenience and flexibility in use.. Based on Internet, electronic commerce is
free from restriction by specialized protocol for data exchange. Transactions can be
conducted conveniently on computer screen, by using any type of PCs, at any place
around the world.
<br>

*Low cost. Use of electronic commerce can cut down costs for hiring employees,
maintaining warehouse and storefront, expense for international travel and postage to
a great extent. The cost for using Internet is very low.
<br>

Electronic commerce will have substantial influence on social economy:
<br>

*Electronic commerce will change the way people used to take in commercial activities. Through networks, people can
enter virtual stores and browse around, select
what they are interested in, and enjoy various on-line services. On the other hand,
merchants can contact with consumers through networks, decide on buying in goods
(categories and quantities) and perform settlement of accounts. Government agencies
can perform electronic tendering and pursue government purchase through networks.
<br>

*The core of electronic commerce is people. It is a social system. On-line shopping changes the way of people's daily
life and fully embodies autonomy of consumers in trade.
<br>

*Electronic commerce changes the way enterprises produce their goods. Through
networks, manufacturers know market demand directly and make arrangement of
production, in accordance with consumers' need.
<br>

*Electronic commerce dramatically raises efficiency of trade. Intermediate links
can be cut down; costs for sales will be reduced to minimum. Production can be arranged in "small batches plus diverse
varieties", and "zero stock" will be reality.
<br>

*Electronic commerce calls for reformation of banking services. New concepts
like on-line bank, on-line cash card and credit card, on-line settlement of accounts,
electronic invoice, electronic "cash"-consumers will no longer use the real cash when
shopping-will become reality.
<br>

*Electronic commerce will change government behavior. Called "on-line government", an on-line administration plays the
important role of a social channel,
maintaining order and fairness and detecting and cracking down on-line fraud.
<br>

3. The Present Situation of Electronic Commerce in Developed Countries
<br>

In the mid-1990s, when Internet experienced explosive development and microcomputers entered homes in great numbers,
computer networks became an indispensable part of people's daily life. People expect for more interests and convenience
brought in by computer networks. Electronic Commerce emerged just in time. In developed countries, governments timely
made policies to boost electronic commerce to
practical use and dominant position in a new round of worldwide competition.
<br>

In 1998, Internet helped the United States to create productive out put of 507 billion US dollars, national income of
301 billion US dollars, and 1. 2 million job opportunities; of these, electronic commerce created an income of 100
billion US dollars.Internet has be-come the first big industry with yearly productive output increasing by
60%，and accounting for 6% of GDP. Service export from the United States has attained 160 billion US dollars each year,
and it is predicted that it can compensate
trade deficit in commodity trade. Internet played an important role in promoting export from the United States: in 1999,
books, automobiles and services were sold
through electronic commerce to foreign countries, exceeding 102 billion US dollars.
<br>
Advocated by the United States, 132 members of WTO decided to turn Internet
into a free trade zone within at least one-year term. Some countries and organizations
scrambled to work out development framework for electronic commerce and made
laws and regulations for developing electronic commerce. In 1996, the UN Conference on Trade and Development passed
"Model Law of Electronic Commerce". In
December, 1996, the US government issued "Policy Framework for Global Electronic
Commerce"．In April 1997, European Union issued "Proposal for Electronic Commerce in Europe"．On July 1 1997, US President
Clinton promulgated" A framework
for Global Electronic Commerce" which has had great influence on global electronic
commerce. In May 1998, WTO minister conference passed "A Manifesto on Global
Electronic Commerce", and in September 1998, WTO general council passed
"Scheme for Electronic Commerce Work"．In October 1998, UN Organization of
Economy and Cooperation ＆ Development (OECD) held minister conference at
Ottawa, Canada on electronic commerce, which is praised as a milestone of global
electronic commerce. In September 1999, Global Business Dialog on Electronic
Commerce (GBDE) was held in France and is-sued "Paris Proposal"．In December
1999, the United States issued another Internet commerce standard.
<br>
Electronic commerce in the United States takes the rein of the trade in the world.
At present, there are 60 million subscribers of Internet in the United States. More than
98% of purchasing managers seek targets on-line. As estimated, by 2002, the value
involved in transactions done through electronic commerce between US enterprises
will account for 6.1% of GDP. Fortune magazine's statistics show the 500 top companies in the world all engaged in
on-line business.25% of income to IBM (about 20
billion US dollars) is related with electronic commerce. Thanks to electronic commerce, IBM saved its expenses of 250
million US dollars during 1999. HP Company designated its electronic Commerce solution as E-world-an electronized world. This
solution is oriented to medium-and small-size enterprises, and great investment was
made to third parties-software companies to develop software suited for medium-and
small-size enterprises to engage in electronic commerce. Intel places its risky investment mainly on Internet and
electronic commerce. In July 1998, Intel began on-line
transactions Its monthly business turn electronic commerce reached one billion US
dollars.
<br>
As a survey made by European Information Technology Observation shows, of
the surveyed 570 companies, 47% have implemented electronic commerce of some
sorts, and 4/5 of them began their electronic commerce in the latest two years. Executive Committee of European Union
plans at least 25% of its purchase done through
electronic commerce by 2001. In1998, in Australia, web sites related with electronic
commerce on Internet doubled in number, and 11% of Australian enterprises have
their web sites. 80% of Australian companies use Internet to transmit E-mails and
conduct commercial activities. In 1998, Singapore government promulgated，for
electronic commerce. Singapore is the only country in Southeast Asia that formally
joined the "Rights and Obligation Electronic commerce In cooperation with US
manufacturers and firms, Singapore established an electronic commerce entry in Asia,
providing comprehensive Business-to-Business (B to B) service, so as to enable Asian
trade companies to enter the rank of global electronic commerce.
<br>
4. Development of Electronic Commerce in China
<br>
Exploration in electronic commerce, governmental and civil began in 1993 in
China. Today, electronic commerce has found its applications in foreign trade, Customs, finance and commerce. Local
frameworks have been established in Beijing and
Shanghai for electronic commerce. Some electronic commerce web sites have been
opened to on-line shopping and on-line settlement of accounts.
<br>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade set up in February 1996 China Electronic Commerce Center responsible for research,
construction, and operation of international
electronic commerce project in CT he Center established "China Commodity Trade
Market" on Internet, to put rich resources of goods in China to world market, opening
new channel for our exports. The subject "Security Proof of Electronic Commerce" as
a key item in science and technology during th9th Five-year Plan period was appraised in early 1996 by State Department
of Science and Technology and State Encryptive Code Administration, which laid a foundation for establishing a safe and
normal environment for electronic commerce in our country.
<br>
In March 1999, the Ministry of Information Industry approved the electronic
commercial network of pharmaceutics and health as a model project of electronic
commerce for all trades. It is one of the six specialized networks in China, which provide all-direction serve of market
information, product transaction, warehousing and
delivery, and account settlement, etc.
<br>
In Shanghai, in 1999, "Shanghai Administrative Center of Electronic Commerce
Security Certificate" was set up, which provide security platform for electronic commerce and is responsible for
application, appraisal, making and management of digital
certificate domestic and foreign clients in Shanghai, and offers services such as certification of digital identity and digital signature, electronic notarization, secure E-mail
and secure encryption, etc. In January 1 the first on-line bookstore in
China-Shanghai Book City On-line standard. It provides VISA cardholders and cardholders of domestic Great Wall card,
Dragon card, Peony card and Pacific card with
instant and authorized security service.
<br>
The measure taken in Beijing to develop electronic commerce is to build a capital
electronic commerce city. In November 1998, the capital electronic commerce project
formally activated, and a frame-work formally showed off. The Legend Computer
Company open edits electronic commerce system in June 1999, and web sites 8848,
sina, 163, all activated their electronic commerce.
In April 2000, sponsored by the Ministry of Information Indus-try，National
Economy and Trade Commission, and China Council for Promotion of International
Trade, the 4th China International Electronic Commerce Conference was held. State
leaders and superintendents of various ministries and commissions joined the opening
conference. Mr. Levy, secretary of Commercial Department of the US government led
a delegation of famous US enterprises and media, totally more than 100 persons, to
join the conference. More than 60 seminars were held during the conference, to discuss extensive topics on electronic
commerce.
<br>
Despite all these efforts, companies engaged in electronic commerce service in
China suffer losses in their B-to-C business (B refers to Business, C refers to Consumers). Some Chinese experts
attribute this to Chinese shopping habit-Chinese consumers treat shopping as an interesting hobby; they enjoy the
pleasure of spending
their money through appreciating and comparing merchandise, and bargaining; but all
these will vanish from on-line shopping. Other experts attribute this phenomenon to
the ubiquitous incredulity in society-banks can-not interconnect their business because they fear their customers will
be captured by their rivals; cash cards cannot be
popularized because banks do not trust civilians; and civilians do not like to do
on-line shopping because they do not trust on-line stores,…etc. Why？That's because
many things on-line and in society are false, for ex-ample, false number of subscribers,
false statistics of access flux, shoddy goods, forged diploma, sham curriculum vitae,
sham investment, sham listing, false revenue to listed enterprises, etc. Such an overall environment will not change
within a long period of time. In such environment, no
commercial activity can be done. Many IT practitioners are disheartened with electronic commerce in our country.
<br>
5. Prospects of Electronic Commerce
Although developing rapidly and seeming to have brilliant prospects, electronic
commerce faces a series of real problems, for example, problems involving security,
technology, expense, legal system, tax system, conception, protection of privacy, infrastructure, etc. However,
electronic commerce is the mainstream of enterprises in
the new century and will develop rapidly in the coming years. Some companies predict that by 2003, electronic commerce
between enterprises in developed countries
will account for over 9%of the total turnover（1,300 billion US dollars）, and in
consumer electronic commerce the turnover will attain 76. 3 billion US dollars by
2002. And as experts predicted, electronic commerce in China will catch up with developed countries on the average
level, in 10 years. They suggested 3 to 5 years be spent on working out plans, policies and regulations necessary for developing electronic commerce, building substantial
and tangible electronic commerce systems, fostering specialized talents, optimizing of the electronic commerce systems in some
trades and areas; and then 5 to 7 years be spent on linking with international electronic commerce to enable our
electronic commerce system as an important component of international electronic commerce; popularizing of electronic
commerce in
application, raising electronic commerce in our country to a higher level in research,
development and application, to the average level in developed countries.
